## Project Title
**A Little About Me**

## Description
In here going to introduce myself and tell a little bit about myself in the process, like what I enjoy, what I don't enjoy and few things inbetween

## Things I Enjoy
- Working out: I very much enjoy working out and spending time being active in my life
- Family & Friends: To me family and friends come first and I care about them deeply as I know they are always there for me
- Trying New Things: I enjoy trying new foods or trying new experiences and enjoy being outside my comfort zone
- Technology: I very much enjoy Excel spreadsheets and other things like that I love data and numbers as I believe they can tell a story or paint a picture
- Football: Grew up playing the game as well as I intend on coaching the sport after I graduate from the University of Iowa I believe it is the best team game and no other one comes close

## Things I do not Enjoy
- Heights: Not a big fan of heights though I do have a bucket list item of going sky diving so kind of counterintuitive
- Cats: Not a huge fan they are kind of more on the creepy side and for some reason they all love me but I'm not the biggest fan
- Reality Tv: Seems very scripted and not one bit a reality so I do not waste my time watching it
